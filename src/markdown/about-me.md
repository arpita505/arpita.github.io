Hey there!

I'm Arpita. I'm currently working as a software engineer in Amadeus Software Labs, Bangalore, India. I work as an Android developer but personally I also enjoy exploring and trying out new technologies. I keep doing interesting things to keep myself busy! I have recently exploring UX and Visual Design as well. *Learning day by day stays the motto of my life!*
