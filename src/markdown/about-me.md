Hey there!

I'm Arpita Singh. I'm a Computer Science graduate from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology and currently working as a software engineer in Amadeus Software Labs, Bangalore, India. I work as an Android developer but personally I also enjoy exploring and trying out new technologies. I keep doing interesting things to keep myself busy!
