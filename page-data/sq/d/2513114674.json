This website was made to showcase all of what I can do and plan to do. Don't judge my writing based on this section though, this is by far my shoddiest work yet.\n\nI got into design because I consider myself a pseudo-perfectionist, if that's even a word? As in, I hate to see things 'not look good'. So I set out on a journey to make products that people use that 'look great', and I'm forever on that path.\n\nI got into development because computers have always fascinated me. `int i = 10;` creates an integer of value 10? _LIKE, WOW!_ But seriously, just seeing code getting converted to things we use regularly, like Facebook or Amazon, was no less than magic to me and that's where my quest to invent began.\n\nI got into photography for a very philosophical reason and a very weird one at that. To me, photography is no less than time-travel. When I look at a photo, I am instantly transported to that moment in time when I shot it, that memory takes over. It's a beautiful art form to express creativity as well, and it's been a passion of mine since my childhood. -->\n<p>I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the <a href=\"#contact\">contact section</a> below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!</p>"}}}
